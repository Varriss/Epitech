#   ¤ For the 1st test, you need a file named "hantill_test1" in the         #
#   bonus directory. The file must contain the input for your program.       #
#                                                                            #
#   ¤ For the 2nd test, you  don't need any particular file.                 #
#                                                                            #
#   ¤ For the 3rd test, you  don't need any particular file.                 #

#   ¤ For the 4th test, you need 3 files : one named "hantill_basictest"     #
#   (same as the file needed for the 1st test), a second empty file named    #
#   "output_basictest" (it will contain the output of the program when it    #
#   will be run) and a third file named "expected.txt" (it must contain the  #
#                    expected output of the program).                        #
#                                                                            #
#   ¤ For the 5th test, you need 3 files : one named "hantill_test1"         #
#   (same as the file needed for the 1st test), a second empty file named    #
#     "output.txt" (it will contain the output of the program when it will   #
#     be run) and a third file named "output_test1" (it must contain the     #
#                    expected output of the program).                        #
#                                                                            #
#   ¤ For the 6th test, you need 3 files : one named "hantill_test2"         #
#   (same as the file needed for the 1st test), a second empty file named    #
#     "output.txt" (it will contain the output of the program when it will   #
#     be run) and a third file named "output_test2" (it must contain the     #
#                    expected output of the program).                        #
#                                                                            #
